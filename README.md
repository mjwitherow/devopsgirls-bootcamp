# DevOpsGirls Bootcamp

In this repository are the slides and content for the DevOpsGirls project, to be held in February 4th in Melbourne, Victoria.

## What you'll need:

To participate in DevOpsGirls, you will need:

 - A working laptop
 - An AWS Free Tier account, if possible
 - If using Windows, an SSH client like [Putty.](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)

## Practicals

DevOpsGirls Bootcamp is composed of four different modules:


1.) [What are EC2 instances?](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/1-1-EC2.md)

2.) [What is an ELB?](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/2-1-ELB.md)

3.) [How do I automate this with Autoscaling Groups?](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/3-1-ASG.md)

Each of the modules represents a continuining improvement on a blog website - a blog that you can login to, and post things in. With each module, we're making the blog more automated, more resilient, and more durable to issues.

If you run into anything, just give your coaches a shout - we'll be happy to help you.

Good luck!
